## Contributing
<p>1. Fork metadata to `username/metadata`. <br/>
2. Clone the project:</p>

```
$ git clone https://github.com/{username}/metadata
```

<p>3. Create your feature branch:</p>

````
$ git checkout -b new-tags
```

<p>4. Add or edit tags. <br/>
5. Make sure your JSON is valid! (We will close any pull request with invalid JSON).  Commit your changes:</p>

```
$ git commit -am 'Changed or added some tags'
```

<p>6. Push to the branch:</p>

```
$ git push origin new-tags
```

<p>7. Create a new Pull Request to the `review` branch.</p>

If everything checks out, and we like your pull request, we'll merge it to `review`.  After merging some other branches to review (besides yours), we'll merge all of the new features to master, where they'll be part of the new release!
